# üêõ BUG FIXES SUMMARY

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ Lyrics Displaying in Single Line (FIXED)
**Root Cause**: Sprite overlap - sprite rects were 39px tall but line spacing was only 32px, causing 7px overlap

**Fix Applied**:
- Increased minimum line height from 32px to 50px
- Fixed sprite surface height to prevent overlap
- Centered text vertically within each sprite

**Files Modified**:
- `ui/pygame_sprite_manager.py`:
  - Line 110: `self.line_height = max(50, int(FONT_SIZE_CURRENT * LINE_SPACING))`
  - Lines 39-54: Fixed `update_surface()` to use fixed height of 50px

**Result**: Lyrics now display with proper spacing, no overlap

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Play/Pause and Skip Buttons Not Working (FIXED)
**Root Cause**: Missing playback control methods in SpotifyController

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `play()` method - resumes playback
- Added `pause()` method - pauses playback
- Added `next()` method - skips to next track
- Added `previous()` method - returns to previous track
- Added `seek_to_position(position_ms)` - seeks to position

**Files Modified**:
- `controllers/spotify_controller.py`:
  - Lines 281-331: Added 5 new playback control methods

**Result**: All playback controls now functional

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Font Unicode Support (IMPROVED)
**Root Cause**: Segoe UI Light variant has limited Devanagari support

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed font priority to: Nirmala UI (best Hindi) ‚Üí Segoe UI ‚Üí Arial
- Avoids "Light" variants which have limited Unicode
- Better Unicode support for multiple scripts

**Files Modified**:
- `ui/pygame_text_renderer.py`:
  - Lines 26-60: Improved `_init_fonts()` with better font selection

**Result**: Hindi/Devanagari and other scripts render correctly
